# Markdown and ReStructuredText Linting

`rocm-docs-core` has linting to ensure correct Markdown and ReStructuredText
formatting on every pull request (PR) via GitHub Actions.

If a PR fails linting, the errors must be addressed before it can be merged.

The results of linting is viewable in the "Checks" tab for a PR.
